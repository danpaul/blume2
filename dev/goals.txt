create command line tool for site generation

create a "turbolinks" option. if enabled, the user would need to define a 'content id' in the body of each page. durring compilation, in addition to the full page, a partial for each page of the 'content div' would also be generated and saved with a standard prefix. a JS file would be included that would disable all internal links and dynamically load/replace only the content section of the page when the user clicks these links.

develop a lookahead client side cache mechanism and data store. this would involve json scanning each site for internal links "viewable" from current and building a cache of this content so the users next click results in an "instant" page update. a base set of cache objects could reside in a compressed/uncompressed json document in the site's root

include the option to have the posts stored in mongo so a cms could be developed as a 'front end'.

include ability programaticly transform front matter
